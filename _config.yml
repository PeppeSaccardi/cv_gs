about_me_description: Hi, I'm Giuseppe Saccardi, a student about to graduate in Mathematics at the University of Trento! Currently working on my Master's Thesis and engaged in the role of Reply Ambassador! Passionate about Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, I am also a technology and renewable energy enthusiast. At the moment I am looking for a job that allows me to work with outstanding and cutting-edge people that will enhance my professional profile! In my free-time I love walking in nature, listening to Podcasts about tech, culture and news, and watching football on TV. Things I am a myth in? I know the secret for cooking the best risotto with prawns!
